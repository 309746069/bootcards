Bootcards: Bootstrap and a Cards UI
=========

**Why?**

We think Cards are the design pattern for mobile of the future. The near future that is. Cards are appearing already on sites and apps like Twitter, Google Now, Spotify, Pinterest and Amazon. To kickstart your (and our) projects we decided to create Bootcards: a Cards-based UI framework built on top of Bootstrap.

**Work in progress**

Bootcards is work in progress. We're currently working hard to get a first release out so stay tuned.
